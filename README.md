#Platformer

Platformer is a 2d platform game. Arrow keys to move.

###Images

Since the images I have at the moment are rubbishy hand-drawn ones (and are quite large) I do not want to upload them. To create your own images, do so as follows (unless otherwise stated, your images can be any size):

1. Make an 'imgs' folder to store the images.
2. In the folder, make a 'player.bmp' (mine is 40x72 pixels).
3. Make a 'door.bmp' (mine is 54x102 pixels).
4. Add a 'fireball.bmp' (mine is 10x10).
5. Add a 'floor.bmp' (mine is 40x40). This gets tiled, so make sure that anything running over an edge is continued on the other side.
6. Add a 'win.bmp' and a 'game_over.bmp' (both should be the same dimensions as the screen).

That's it!
